	<aside>
	<p>Analyzing descriptive statistics may lead you to ask new questions. For example, perc_enjoy is much higher on average than perc_usefulness, which also has a large variance. This suggests that a segment of users may not have considered the system useful even though they enjoyed using it.</p>
	</aside>
	
	<p> Run descriptive (summary) statistics on the dataset and output results in a new spreadsheet. If necessary, rearrange columns so that data requiring summary, those with continuous values, are adjacent. (In the spreadsheet, the continuous values of perc_enjoy, perc_usefulness, and perc_ease_of_use are already adjacent.) </p>
	
	<p> Write down the "input range" (i.e. H2:J26) of the data requiring summary, making sure not to include variable labels. </p>
	
	<ul>
		<li> Go to <b>Tools -> Add-Ins...</b> and make sure the <b>Analysis ToolPak</b> is checked. Click OK.</li>
		<li> Go to <b>Tools -> Data Analysis</b> and select <b>Descriptive Statistics</b>. Click OK. </li>
		<li> Enter the input range in the blank and check <b>Summary Statistics</b>. Click OK. </li>
	</ul>
	
	<p> The descriptive statistics summary will output in a new sheet. Rename this spreadsheet Descriptive_Stats. Label the output according to the variables. For example, Column 1 should be perc_enjoy. Your Descriptive_Stats spreadsheet should now look like Figure 4.
Analyzing descriptive statistics is a great way to start appraising a dataset before running inferential statistics. What insights about the dataset can you glean from the summary statistics for perc_usefulness and perc_ease_of_use? </p>

	<p> CAPTION: Excel will not run descriptive statistics with non-numeric characters, so the variable labels must be re-entered. </p>
